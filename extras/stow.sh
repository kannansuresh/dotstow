# Stow All Packages Script
#
# This script is a convenience wrapper around GNU Stow to symlink all packages
# (subdirectories) from the dotfiles repository to the target directory. It
# includes special handling for macOS environments and junk file cleanup.
#
# It can stow all packages by default, or a single specified package.
#
# Usage:
#   ./stow.sh
#   ./stow.sh --only <package_name>
#
# Example:
#   # Stow all packages (e.g., nvim, zsh, git)
#   ./stow.sh
#   # Stow only the 'nvim' package
#   ./stow.sh --only nvim
#

# Determine the absolute path of the dotfiles repository (the directory
# containing this script) to ensure it runs correctly from any location.
DOTFILES_DIR="$(cd "$(dirname "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}")" && pwd)"
TARGET_DIR="$HOME"

# Change to the dotfiles directory to execute stow commands correctly.
cd "$DOTFILES_DIR" || exit 1
